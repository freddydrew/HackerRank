#Welcome to my [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) repository.
This is where I keep all things I do from HackerRank. So far that includes:

- 30 Days to Code, A tutorial series offered for free [here.](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code) I completed the series in Python even though the course is in Java because I wanted to become more comfortable with the former. Most code and notes are in Jupyter Notebooks.
